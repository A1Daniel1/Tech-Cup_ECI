 * <b>Strategy pattern</b> for turning a list of teams into fixtures. The two phases of the

 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link RoundRobinFixtureStrategy} — the group stage: everybody plays everybody once,
 *       split into matchdays with the circle method.</li>
 *   <li>{@link KnockoutFixtureStrategy} — the bracket: the seeded list is folded in half so the
 *       first meets the last.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Keeping the two algorithms behind one interface is what makes the fixture generator testable
 * without a database, and adding a third format (two groups, home and away, …) a matter of
 * writing one more implementation.
